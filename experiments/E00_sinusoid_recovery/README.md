# Sinusoid Recovery with a Tiny Transformer

Recover a clean sinusoid from noisy observations using a small transformer (~29K parameters) trained as an autoregressive next-sample predictor. This is a bridge between classical DSP (AR/MA models, PACF) and modern sequence modeling.

## TL;DR — design in three parameters

The whole architecture falls out of three DSP-anchored choices:

| Hyperparameter | What it is | DSP anchor | Sizing rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`n_heads`** | Parallel attention patterns | Number of AR taps / lags that matter | `≈ effective AR order` |
| **`context_length`** | How far back attention can look | N_FFT — covers the slowest period | `≈ fs / f_min`, rounded up |
| **`head_dim`** | Discrimination width of each head's Q·K match | Codeword length for position addressing | `≈ 2 · log₂(context_length)` |

`emb_dim = n_heads × head_dim` is forced by construction — not an independent choice.

### Worked example for this project

| Step | Reasoning | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Sinusoid = AR(2) → 2 lags matter | Number of AR taps | `n_heads = 2` |
| `fs = 100 Hz`, `f_min = 1 Hz` → 100 samples/period | Cover ≥ 1 period, round up to power of 2 | `context_length = 128` |
| 128 positions to discriminate | `2 · log₂(128) = 14`, round up | `head_dim = 16` |
| Total embedding width | `n_heads × head_dim` | `emb_dim = 32` |

Everything below elaborates on these three choices.

## Motivation

In classical time-series analysis, we fit an **AR (AutoRegressive)** or **MA (Moving Average)** model by finding filter taps such that the residual is white noise. The number of taps is guided by the **PACF** (Partial AutoCorrelation Function).

**Key DSP fact:** A pure sinusoid at angular frequency ω₀ satisfies the second-order linear recurrence

```
x[n] = 2·cos(ω₀)·x[n-1] - x[n-2]
```

i.e., it is an **AR(2)** process. So in principle, only 2 past samples are needed to predict the next one.

**Thesis:** A transformer doing next-sample prediction on a sequence of noisy samples should *implicitly* learn this AR structure. Self-attention acts as a data-dependent filter, and the learned attention weights over past positions should correspond to AR coefficients.

## Architecture overview

```

            |
      Linear(1, 32)          <- input projection (replaces token embedding)
            |
     + PosEmbedding[t]
            |
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │ TransformerBlock│       <- 2 layers, causal self-attention
   │ TransformerBlock│          (reused from ch04 GPT code)

      Linear(32, 1)          <- output head (scalar, not vocab)
            |
     predicted x̂[t+1]
```

**Configuration** (in `ts_transformer.py`):

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `context_length` | 128 | Covers ≥1 period of the lowest frequency (1 Hz at fs=100 → 100 samples) |
| `emb_dim` | 32 | Each token is a scalar; small representation suffices |
| `n_heads` | 2 | One head can latch onto lag-1, another on lag-2 |
| `n_layers` | 2 | Minimal depth; the problem is near-linear |
| `drop_rate` | 0.05 | Light regularisation |

Total trainable parameters: **~29K** — ~4 orders of magnitude smaller than a typical LLM.

## Choosing `context_length`: the N_FFT analogy

There's a direct parallel between `context_length` in a transformer and `N_FFT` in an OFDM/DFT-based system.

| OFDM / LTE `N_FFT` | This model's `context_length` |
|---|---|
| Frequency resolution `Δf = fs / N_FFT` | Resolution of periodicities attention can distinguish |
| Lowest resolvable tone needs `N_FFT ≥ fs / f_min` | Lowest sinusoid needs `context_length ≥ fs / f_min` |
| Power of 2 for FFT efficiency | Power of 2 is convenient (not required) |

Our choice of **128** at `fs=100 Hz, f_min=1 Hz` gives `Δf ≈ 0.78 Hz`, which comfortably separates tones in the 1–20 Hz training range. Time span covered: `128 / 100 = 1.28 s`, enough for at least one full period of the slowest sinusoid.

### LTE-style sizing for reference

| Bandwidth | Sampling rate | N_FFT |
|---|---|---|
| 1.4 MHz | 1.92 MHz | 128 |
| 3 MHz | 3.84 MHz | 256 |
| 5 MHz | 7.68 MHz | 512 |
| 10 MHz | 15.36 MHz | 1024 |
| 20 MHz | 30.72 MHz | 2048 |

Notice that `N_FFT / fs ≈ 66.7 µs` stays constant across LTE configurations — the OFDM symbol time. The analogous invariant for us is the **time span** `context_length / fs`.

### When to scale up `context_length`

Following the same DSP logic:

1. **Wider frequency range** — to resolve `f_min = 0.1 Hz`, need `context_length ≥ 1000`.
2. **Finer frequency discrimination** — closely spaced tones (e.g., 4.9 and 5.1 Hz) need `Δf < 0.2 Hz`, so `context_length > 500`.
3. **Multi-tone / composite signals** — roughly `context_length ≥ K · fs / Δf_min` for K tones.

### Important caveat

In OFDM, `N_FFT` *exactly* determines the spectral basis — the transform is fixed. In a transformer, `context_length` is the **maximum lag** attention can reach, but attention is **learned and data-dependent**. For a sinusoid (AR(2)), the model typically only uses lags 1 and 2 even when given 128 positions to work with.

So think of `context_length` as the **attention budget**, analogous to `N_FFT`, but the model may use only a small fraction of it.

**Rule of thumb for sizing:**
- Start with `context_length ≈ fs / f_min`, rounded up (to a power of 2 is fine).
- Add 2–4× headroom so attention can observe multiple periods (helps generalization and noise rejection).
- Don't over-provision — attention cost is quadratic in `context_length`.

## Tokenization and embedding

A key difference from standard LLM transformers: **there is no tokenizer**. The inputs are already continuous floating-point numbers (sample values like `0.823, -0.451, ...`). Each scalar sample *is* a "token" in the sense that it occupies one position in the sequence.

### Standard GPT vs this model

| Step | Standard GPT | This model |
|---|---|---|
| Input | Text string | Float array of samples |
| Split | BPE tokenizer → int IDs | None — already numeric |
| Lookup | `nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d)` | `nn.Linear(1, d)` |
| Math | `E[token_id]` (row pick from table) | `W · x + b` (affine map) |
| Learnable | Whole embedding table (`vocab × d`) | `W` (`d × 1`) + `b` (`d`) |

### How scalars become embeddings

From `ts_transformer.py`:

```python
self.input_proj = nn.Linear(1, cfg["emb_dim"])   # 1 → 32
```

Forward pass:
```python
x = x.unsqueeze(-1)              # (batch, 128)   → (batch, 128, 1)
tok_embeds = self.input_proj(x)  # (batch, 128, 1) → (batch, 128, 32)
```

So each scalar `v` becomes the 32-D vector `W · v + b`. Every sample uses the *same* `W` and `b`, so this has only 64 parameters total (32 weights + 32 bias).

### Why a linear layer works here

`nn.Embedding` for discrete tokens is effectively a linear map from a *one-hot* vector to `emb_dim`. But the "vocabulary" here would be uncountably infinite (all real numbers), so a lookup table is impossible. A linear projection generalises naturally: the embedding of sample value `v` is a fixed direction in 32-D space scaled by `v`.

This gives a useful inductive bias:
- `embed(2.0) = 2 · embed(1.0)` — linear scaling in the sample value maps to linear scaling in the embedding
- `embed(0) = b` — the bias is the "zero sample" embedding
- Neighbouring sample values (e.g., `0.51` and `0.52`) produce almost-identical embeddings, rather than unrelated vectors as would be the case with discrete tokenization

### Are the 32 output dimensions redundant?

A natural question: if the projection is `h = W · v + b` with scalar `v`, aren't the 32 output values just 32 scaled copies of the same number? The answer is **no, but they are perfectly correlated**.

For a single scalar `v`:

```
h[0]  = W[0]  · v + b[0]
h[1]  = W[1]  · v + b[1]
...
h[31] = W[31] · v + b[31]
```

Each output dimension has its **own learned `W[i]` and `b[i]`** — so the 32 values are different numbers. But as `v` varies, all 32 components move in lockstep along a single line in 32-D space (direction `W`, anchored at `b`). The matrix of embeddings over all possible `v` is **rank 1**.

So why use 32 dimensions at all? The capacity isn't wasted:

1. **Positional embedding breaks the rank-1 structure.** After adding `P[t]`, each position gets a different offset in 32-D space, so the combined (sample, position) representation can live anywhere in 32 dimensions.
2. **Attention projections mix dimensions.** Q/K/V matrices can rotate and combine the content and positional components differently at each head.
3. **The FFN is nonlinear.** After a GELU, the representation is no longer an affine function of `v`, so the space is genuinely used.

In short: the 32-D embedding is mostly **housing for positional information and intermediate nonlinear computation**, not for encoding the scalar sample value itself (which only needs 1 dimension).

You could set `emb_dim = 1` and the content part would still work — but positional embeddings would collapse to a scalar offset per time step, attention dot products would be trivial, and the FFN would have almost no capacity. So 32 is a compromise: enough room for the transformer to do useful work, but much smaller than the 768+ dims of a real LLM.

### Positional embedding (unchanged from GPT)

```python
self.pos_emb = nn.Embedding(context_length, emb_dim)   # 128 → 32
pos_embeds = self.pos_emb(torch.arange(seq_len))
x = tok_embeds + pos_embeds
```

Each of the 128 positions has a learned 32-D vector, added to the projected sample. This lets the model know *when* each sample was observed — essential for exploiting periodicity.

### Putting it together

For a single sample value `v` at position `t`, the vector entering the transformer blocks is:

```
h_t = W · v + b + P[t]
      └─────┘   └──┘
      sample    position
     (content)  (timing)
```

That's the entire "tokenization and embedding" pipeline — two linear layers, ~4K parameters total. The transformer blocks then do the heavy lifting.

### Alternative: FFT as embedding

An alternative proposed during design was to use a short-time FFT as the embedding front-end:
1. Slide a small window (e.g., 16 samples) centred on each position.
2. Compute its FFT → `(window_size//2 + 1)` complex bins → real/imag pairs.
3. Feed those features through `Linear(n_features, emb_dim)`.

This would give the model local spectral context at each position, without waiting for attention to discover it. For the simple sinusoid problem, raw scalars worked well — but this is a natural extension for harder signals (multi-tone, non-stationary, chirps).

## Pipeline walkthrough

### 1. Data generation (`signal_dataset.py`)

Each training example is generated **on the fly**. For every `__getitem__` call:

1. Sample **freq** ∼ U(1, 20) Hz, **amplitude** ∼ U(0.5, 2.0), **phase** ∼ U(0, 2π)
2. Build time vector `t = [0, 1, ..., N] / fs` with `fs = 100` Hz (well above Nyquist)
3. Compute the **clean** signal:
   ```
   clean[n] = A · sin(2π·f·t[n] + φ)
   ```
4. Inject **amplitude noise** (AWGN on A) and **phase noise** (AWGN on φ):
   ```
   noisy[n] = (A + ε_A[n]) · sin(2π·f·t[n] + φ + ε_φ[n])
   ```
   where `ε_A ∼ N(0, 0.2)` and `ε_φ ∼ N(0, 0.1)` by default.
5. Return:
   - `input_seq  = noisy[0 .. N-1]`   (context)
   - `target_seq = clean[1 .. N]`     (next clean sample at every position)

This shift-by-one, parallel target-at-every-position setup mirrors standard GPT training: at position `t` the model must predict the clean signal value at time `t+1` given noisy history `[0..t]`.

Randomising frequency every batch forces the model to learn a **generic AR predictor**, not memorise one specific sinusoid.

### 2. Model forward pass (`ts_transformer.py`)

Given `x` of shape `(batch, 128)`:

1. **Unsqueeze** to `(batch, 128, 1)` so each scalar can be linearly projected.
2. **Input projection** `Linear(1 → 32)` embeds each sample.
3. **Positional embedding** `Embedding(128 → 32)` adds learned per-position vectors — this is critical: the model needs to know *when* each sample was observed to exploit periodicity.
4. Pass through two **TransformerBlock**s (imported from `transformer_blocks.py`, a verbatim extract from the repo's ch04 GPT). Each block is:
   - LayerNorm → causal MultiHeadAttention → residual
   - LayerNorm → FFN (GELU) → residual
5. Final **LayerNorm** + **output head** `Linear(32 → 1)`, then squeeze to `(batch, 128)`.

Because the attention mask is strictly causal (upper-triangular `-inf`), the prediction at position `t` only sees positions `0..t`.

### 3. Training (`train.py`)

- **Loss:** MSE between predicted scalar and clean target at every position (regression, not classification — so no cross-entropy, no tokenisation, no vocab).
- **Optimizer:** AdamW, lr = 1e-3, weight_decay = 0.01.
- **Batches:** 32 sequences per batch; 10,000 synthetic sequences per epoch (fresh each time).
- **Metric:** SNR improvement (dB) compared to a **naive persistence predictor** that uses `noisy[t]` as the prediction for `clean[t+1]`. This is a fair baseline because both the model and the naive predictor see the same information up to time `t`.

Run:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 30
```

Output files:
- `ts_transformer.pth` — trained weights
- `training_results.pdf` — loss curves (log-scale MSE) + SNR improvement over steps

Observed convergence: MSE drops from ~1.4 → ~0.03 over 30 epochs on CPU; final output SNR ≈ naive-baseline SNR, meaning the model successfully predicts the next *clean* sample from noisy history (which is strictly harder than just matching the current noisy value).

### 4. Analysis (`analyze.py`)

Four diagnostics connect the learned model back to DSP concepts:

#### a. Attention heatmaps (`attention_analysis.pdf`)
For each test frequency, feed a clean sinusoid into the trained model and plot the attention matrix `(query × key)` for each layer. We expect a strong diagonal band just below the main diagonal — indicating queries attend to a few recent keys.

#### b. Attention vs lag profile (`attention_lag_profile.pdf`)
Collapse the 2-D attention matrix into a 1-D profile: *average attention weight as a function of lag `q - k`*. For an AR(2) process, this should peak at **lag 1 and lag 2**. The theoretical AR(1) coefficient `2·cos(ω₀)` is printed for comparison — it changes with frequency, which is why the model must be *frequency-aware* (hence randomising training frequencies).

#### c. Denoising comparison (`denoising_XHz.pdf`)
Time-domain overlay: noisy input vs model prediction vs clean target. Bottom panel is the FFT magnitude — the noisy spectrum has a broadband floor while the model's output concentrates energy at the fundamental frequency, similar to a narrowband filter.

#### d. Autoregressive generation (`autoreg_XHz.pdf`)
Feed the model a short noisy seed, then let it extend the signal by *consuming its own predictions* (sliding window of the last 128 samples). Because the model has learned the AR(2) structure for that frequency, the generated samples lock onto a clean sinusoid — visible as the output converging to the clean reference past the seed/generation boundary.

Run:
```bash
python analyze.py --test-freqs 2.0 5.0 10.0 18.0
```

## Connection to AR/MA theory — what to look for

| DSP concept | Transformer analogue |
|---|---|
| AR order (how many lags matter) | Effective receptive field of attention — read off from the attention-vs-lag profile |
| AR coefficients | Encoded jointly in the attention weights, value projections, and FFN |
| PACF cutoff | Lag beyond which attention weight falls to ~0 |
| Fitting AR by least squares (Yule-Walker) | Gradient descent on MSE loss |
| Wiener filter / Kalman filter | The trained model acts as a learned non-linear filter; for a pure sinusoid + AWGN both should converge to essentially the same optimum |

## Caveats and honest limitations

- **This problem is massively over-engineered for an LLM.** A 2-tap linear AR(2) estimator (Yule-Walker on a buffer of a few hundred samples) will match or beat this model at a tiny fraction of the compute. The point of this exercise is *pedagogical*: showing that a transformer naturally absorbs AR structure.
- **Generalisation is bounded by the training distribution.** Frequencies outside [1, 20] Hz won't be handled well; neither will non-stationary signals or multi-tone mixtures.
- **FFT as embedding** (from the original proposal) is not implemented here — raw scalar + positional embedding was sufficient. A short-time FFT front-end would be the natural next experiment for more complex signals.
- **d_model ↔ PACF mapping is loose.** PACF governs *how far back* to look (→ `context_length`), not the per-position representation width (`emb_dim`). For a pure sinusoid, `context_length` could in principle be as small as ~3.
